        "Enjoy a bike that makes urban cycling easy with the Loop by Schwinn. The Loop features a folding steel frame that’s both durable and exceptionally convenient for those with limited storage space. The 7-speed twist shifter provides smooth gear changes, while the front and rear linear pull brakes deliver secure stops. The 20-inch alloy wheel with smooth rolling street tires are perfect for your weekday commute or weekend ride around town. The rear carrier with included heavy-gauge nylon bag makes is super easy to haul your backpack, groceries, or whatever else you need to carry on your ride. Then, when you’re all done, just fold the bike right up into its ultra-compact storage configuration, and you can tuck it away until it’s time to go again. Like all Schwinn bikes, the Loop comes with a limited lifetime warranty for as long as you own the bike. Convenience is the name of the game with the Loop. Enjoy the freedom of riding a Schwinn.",

        "Versatile — that's what's always made our progressive trail bikes popular. These are bikes that are as at home blasting down trails alongside long-travel, full-suspension bikes as they are surfing mellow sections of singletrack. The Sync'r is our top of the line, do-it-all aluminum hardtail. The heart of the bike is a low-slung frame that's both playful and confident. We've hung the Sync'r chassis with equally stellar components that include a RockShox Recon RL suspension fork with 140mm of travel and a SRAM SX Eagle 1x12, single-ring drivetrain with a wide, 11-50 gear range. Powerful Shimano hydraulic disc brakes modulate speed precisely, and our own Diamondback AL35 tubeless-compatible wheelset delivers knife-sharp handling with durability at its core.",
